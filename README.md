# Data Architecture Overview

![Dashboard Preview](docs/project_diagram.png)

This project is built on the Medallion Architecture, leveraging a structured, multi-layered approach for efficient data processing and analytics. The architecture consists of three key layers:

ðŸ”¸ Bronze Layer
   Acts as the raw data storage layer, capturing information exactly as it arrives from source systems.
   Data is ingested from CSV files into a SQL Server database without modifications.
ðŸ”¹ Silver Layer
   Focuses on data refinement, including cleansing, standardization, and normalization.
   Ensures data quality and consistency, making it ready for further transformation and analysis.
ðŸŸ¡ Gold Layer
   Designed for business intelligence and analytics, storing curated and structured data.
   Organized using a star schema, making it optimized for reporting and decision-making.
   This architecture enables scalability, maintainability, and performance, ensuring a smooth ETL workflow from raw data to actionable insights. ðŸš€
